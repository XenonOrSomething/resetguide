            <p>good job, you downloaded a rat. you've probably been sent this guide by me after admitting to downloading something that has proven to be ratted. anyways, heres how to factory reset your PC to get rid of it.</p>
            <div class="spacer"></div>
            <p>examples of things that can be rats:</p>
            <p>mod menus and cheats for games, cracked software (you shouldnt be downloading pirated stuff anyways as it is illegal), or basically anything from a sketchy website</p>
            <div class="spacer"></div>
            <h1>WARNING: THIS WILL DELETE <strong class="bold">EVERYTHING</strong>  ON YOUR PC, <strong class="bold">MAKE SURE TO BACK UP EVERYTHING THATS IMPORTANT</strong></h1>
            <div class="spacer"></div>
            <p>most people probably ignore this, but since this removes <strong class="bold">everthing</strong> from your pc, and i cant stress this enough, <strong class="bold">MAKE SURE TO BACK UP EVERYTHING ON YOUR PC</strong></p>
            
            <div class="spacer"></div>

            <p>alright, now that youve <strong class="bold">backed up everything important</strong> on your pc, time to reset it.</p>
            <p>you will want to click <a href="ms-settings:recovery">here</a> to open recovery settings, or the link below. you can also just search for recovery settings in windows settings.</p>

            <a href="ms-settings:recovery">open recovery settings</a>
            
            <p>now click "reset this PC", and select <strong class="bold">remove everything</strong>. you wil want to do this, because if you keep files, the rat will likely stay.</p>
            <h1>remember, <strong class="bold">BACK UP EVERYTHING IMPORTANT</strong></h1>
            <p>when prompted, select "cloud download", and follow the steps on screen.</p>
